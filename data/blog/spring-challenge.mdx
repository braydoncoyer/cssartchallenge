# Welcome to CSS Art Challenge!

Hello and welcome to our first CSS challenge! One of the best ways to learn is to take concepts and implement them in a fun and engaging way - that's why I created CSS Art Challenge.
I want to help people discover that CSS can be fun and more than just creating basic layouts!

## How does CSS Art Challenge work?

The idea behind CSS Art Challenge is simple - each month, a new challenge will be posted here on this website detailing the requirements for the challenge. A deadline will be supplied too - make sure you get your entry in before the deadline!
Speaking of submitting your entry, after you've completed your CSS art, you'll submit your piece by posting on Twitter and including a unique hashtag that will be included in the challenge details each month (find this month's hashtag by reading on).

After the deadline, all of the valid CSS art will be collected and a winner will be chosen at random from the submission pool. I will reach out to the winner via Twitter DM and send them the monthly prize! (Make sure you're following the [CSS Art Challenge Twitter account](https://twitter.com/css_art) so I can DM you!)

The prize for winning a CSS Art Challenge will differ from month to month.

**Check the challenge details to peek at the prize! We've got an amazing prize for the first challenge!**
