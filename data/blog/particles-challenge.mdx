## Announcing the March 2022 Winner

Happy April to all of you! 👋

We had a great turnout for our first CSS challenge last month. The [March theme was spring](https://www.cssartchallenge.com/challenge/spring-challenge) and we were extremely impressed with the submissions! From [bunny rabbits peeking out of a hole](https://codepen.io/alaa-anan1/pen/rNpNveO) to [blissful flowers blowing in the breeze](https://codepen.io/alvaromontoro/pen/bGaNdLp) and a [slinky infinitely jumping across the page](https://codepen.io/jh3y/pen/WNXBdyZ), the community really came together and made some fantastic art!

Before the winner is announced, take a few minutes to look at [all of the wonderful submissions](https://codepen.io/collection/zxNNRb) by you - the community!

There could only be one winner and, as per the details of the March challenge, the winner was chosen at random.

🥁 ...

🎉 Congratulations to Alaa ([@Lilo1170](https://twitter.com/Lilo1170)) for winning the first-ever CSS Art Challenge! 🎉

Now, let’s go on to this month’s challenge...

## 🎨 April 2022 CSS Art Challenge Details

We’re going to be a little more open-ended this month. For April, create any piece of CSS art you’d like, but your submission must include **_•◦•· particles •◦•·_** ! Now, this doesn’t mean your submission has to _only_ include particles - rather, we’d love to see CSS art that uses particles to enhance the piece.

Particles add a layer of movement and an extra bit of eye candy. Perhaps you can use particles to blow leaves across your scene, or maybe you’ll use smoke particles to add some mystery and shroud your centerpiece.

Be creative and enjoy the process! We can’t wait to see what you come up with!

**💭 Idea Prompts (not required):**

- Create a tree out of CSS with leaf particles and blow them off of the tree
- Create a volcano out of CSS and use particles to act as the smoke billowing out of the top
- Create a micro-interactive button that shoots confetti particles when you click on it
